# Google_Play_Store Analytical Project

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I have taken up <b>Google Play Store</b> as a project domain for performing analytics and examining the metrics available. I have evaluated and executed multiple preliminary steps of data cleaning. Through the analysis, I have been aiming to identify trends and patterns in the dataset and come up with suitable concluding remarks for the project.<br></br>
I have utilized <b>Microsoft Excel</b> and <b>Tableau</b> in the data manipulation and visualization processes and have tried to inculcate the patterns with some advanced visualization like <b>Box & Whisker Plots</b> for an intrinsic understanding of the analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

Before loading the data straight into the Tableau Software, it has been screened through multiple parameters using <b>Excel Tools</b> as mentioned below:<br>

- Adjusting and eliminating unnecessary column spaces

- Rejecting blank/missing values
- Formatting Pricing & Reviews column to maintain uniformity
